# Instagram Clone 
**<p>In this project, I created an Instagram clone with React and Firebase. You can share posts, see and like other people's posts. You can also message the people you follow. Redux Toolkit was used for state management operations. Firebase was used for database and user authentication operations.</p>**

<strong><ul>
<li>Authentication: You must log in to use the site. Users are also given the opportunity to log in with Facebook. </li>  
<li>Post Sharing: You can share a photo of your choice and add a description if you wish. You can delete this post later if you wish. You can also see the posts of the users you follow.</li>  
<li>Following and unfollowing users:
You can search for users and follow or unfollow them.</li>  
<li>Live Messaging:
You can message the users you follow.</li>  
<li>Profile settings: 
You can change your bio and change your profile photo as well.
</li>
